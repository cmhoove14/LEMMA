\subsection{Abstract}\label{abstract}}

COVID19 testing data is essential to monitor the status of ongoing
epidemics across the U.S. and the world. Because of the high rate of
asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases that contribute to
transmission, widespread testing and subsequent contact tracing and
isolation are necessary to reduce epidemic spread The effective
reproductive rate, \(\mathcal{R}_e\), is a simple measure of
transmission interpreted as the expected number of new infections
arising from a single infection at a given time, that can be used to
monitor the status of an outbreak. Here we discuss estimation of
\(\mathcal{R}_e\) from currently available testing data and proprose
methods to correct for inherent biases that currently limit the utility
of testing as a reliable indicator of the status of the COVID19
pandemic.

Areas across the United States and the world are beginning to reopen
following the unprecedented pandemic caused by the emergence of
SARS-CoV2. Widespread availability of testing for active and past
infections remains a critical component of the ongoing response to the
COVID19 pandemic\ldots{}

Hospitalizations and deaths are more what we're worried about, but these
are preceded in time by increase in cases. Since tests can detect
infection before these more severe outcomes, they can be an earlier
indicator of increases in transmission. A useful summary statistic to
estimate the current status of an outbreak is \(\mathcal{R}_e\), the
expected number of additional cases caused by a single case at any time
during the outbreak {[}1{]}.

Testing can be used in either passive or active surveillance to monitor
the status of ongoing outbreaks. Especially early in the outbreak when
testing was not widely available, the set of individuals allowed (wc?)
to be tested was restricted. To date, most COVID19 testing data has been
passively collected: those with suspected COVID19 exposure or symptoms
seek out testing from a healthcare provider, rather than actively being
pursued to be tested in a more systematic fashion, e.g.~as part of a
representative cohort of the population of interest. This introduces
considerable bias into epidemiological estimates derived from the
testing data, such as \(\mathcal{R}_e\). {[}Review CITEs on passive
surveillance and bias{]} The number of tests available, test-seeking
behaviors of different populations/individuals, and {[}something else{]}
all influence the number of positive tests and the positive test percent
in a given location and time (Figure 1, W2; \textbf{Maybe could add
\(\mathcal{R}_e\) to the DAG as a function of \(Y\)?}).

Crude metrics from testing data such as the number of positive tests
reported or the percent of tests conducted that are positive have
been/are being used to monitor the status of outbreaks across the
US/world. However, such metrics are heavily biased due to reasons
outlines above, and may be flawed representations of true underlying
infection dynamics such as \(\mathcal{R}_e\) {[}\textbf{Think this
sentence/point is really important and could use some work}{]}. Here we
propose/review methods for correcting for these underlying biases in
testing data, discuss their pros and cons, and evaluate their ability to
a) estimate \(\mathcal{R}_e\) in real time and b) predict a future
increase in hospitalizations that will overwhelm capacity. We conclude
by proposing methods to generate unbiased testing data prospectively
using adaptive design (active surveillance, embedding prospective
cohorts within passive testing, all/none of the above?) and
{[}hopefully{]} show that these methods outperform those currently
available that rely on inherent flaws in currently available testing
data.

  status, age, etc.)\\
\item
  Can additional data be collected in order to improve the utility of
  available testing resources

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Intuition is that smart reallocation of testing to do some active
    surveillance will improve estimation even more than just doing more
    tests, which I think could/should be one of the main messages\\
  \item
    Could maybe start with data from the Mission Study, use it to derive
    age/race/income? adjusted rates for all of SF, compare to testing
    data reported for all of SF county at the same time. Could provide
    an initial estimate of testing bias. Would be even better if we
    could do record linkage between Mission Study and other testing data
