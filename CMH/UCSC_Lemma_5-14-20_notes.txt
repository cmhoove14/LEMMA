UCSC LEMMA Meeting 5/14/2020
-Mikala SC County communicable disease epidemiologist
	-Disease modeling syndromic surveillance
	-New reopening metrics from Newsom
	
-Paul - Ocean Sciences and statistics; dynamical modeling of ocean sciences
	-SEIR with some uncertainty built in; coded in STAN
	
-Age structured data tried to incorporate but model didn't work great; not enough degrees of freedom
	-One age group with everyone inside
	-Hospitalizations quite low and ICU proportion quite high
		-Going from I from model to I_observed (to fit data to)
			-Doesn't vary through time, but does incorporate testing fraction
			-Data on hospitalizations and ICU
			-Data on mortality (maybe most trustworthy)
				-Probably constrains the model the most
		-Beta fit with spline and allowed to vary through time
			-User can put in prescribed variations in beta to simulate projections in time to the future
			-Allow data input via txt, csv, xlsx
			-*Noncumulative data
				-Using hospitalized census data
			-Currently using normal distributions for most of the input parameters
			-Initial distribution of when outbreak started
			-Rhat: measure of how everything has converged
	-Spits out estimates of beta through time, mortality through time, detection rate through time, etc.
-Starting to get some seroprevalence data, e.g. from the Mission study
	-2% PCR positive of 4000 people in the mission (initial results)
		-Antibody results still pending
	-Extension of models to consider different types of populations
	-Another 6000 person seroprevalence survey starting in the East Bay
-Started in decision support role with SFDPH and then expanded a lot
	-Where are we going?
		-Original use case was hospitalization projections
		-Evolved into helping SFDPH
		-Helping through scenarios to lift Shelter in PLace
			-Mitigation strategies
		-Understanding of different interventions and their potential effects 
		-Monitoring strategies for when epidemic curves start going up
			-Bringing in different types of data
				-E.g. infections data -> time-varying reporting fractions
			-Pushing availability to fit to multiple data sources
		-Sub-populations dynamics; epidemics within specific populations
			-Primary data collection in Berkeley of long. cohorts testing and risk factors
				-How to integrate modeling work with this data
				-Implications for modifying intervention strategies
		-Contact tracing: how much is needed? How many tests?
	-Is public data available yet?
		-Hospitalizations data available on CDPH (CHHS) website
			-Case data from Hopkins
	-SC transitioning to reopening as a check in to make sure as things are lifted that things don't start bouncing back
		-Updates to model, time dependent testing fractions
		-Number of lives saved (e.g. by sheltering place; hospitalizations avoided)
			-Measuring the impact
	-Descartes labs mobility data
		-Can we lift and have mobility and beta/Rt track less
