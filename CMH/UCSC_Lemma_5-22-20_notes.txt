UCSC LEMMA 5/22/20
-Some agenda items: should we go to a full MCMC/STAN approach?
-Some potential updates to models
	-Time dependent testing
	-Open population, e.g. case importation
	-SafeGraph data: mobility /movement data between counties that could inform 
-Comparisons between models 
	-UCSC fitting to hospitalizations, cases, deaths, icus
		-Also ran model more recently, so comparisons to LEMMA are maybe using a bit less data
	-LEMMA doesn't have case fitting because of testing issue, but could turn on if necessary
		-Maybe need to move towards more data-driven inflection points?
			-Movement data influences R, more inflection points, something like that
	-Would be good to have some way to review past projections and see how they're doing in comparison to present/truth	
	
	-Alameda
		-R looking a bit uncertain, hovering around 1 or so
	-SF
		-UCSC
			-Has a bit of a bump in early May, unkown why
			-Rt appears to be less than 1
			-Only confirmed cases, not incorporating PUIs
		-LEMMA
			-Median Rt appears to be ~0.86, prettyuch the same as UCSC model
			-Maybe becoming less reliable to rely on prior estimates for R/when R changes
	-SC
		-UCSC
			-R maybe going up again here?
		-LEMMA
			-Median R around 0.74, very little data (few hospitalizations, icus, etc.)
	-Santa Clara
		-UCSC
			-Starts a bit late, no hospitalizations until early April
			-Sort of builds in early stage of exponential growth to get to these high initial numbers
			-Rt a bit below 1 again, 0.8 or so
		-LEMMA
			-Rt aroud 0.7ish
