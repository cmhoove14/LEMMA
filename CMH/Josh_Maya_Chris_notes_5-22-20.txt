Josh Maya Chris 5/22/20 notes
- Josh found which counties had increases in mobility and which had enough data and then tried to determine if mobility actually influences cases
	- Data from anywhere other than CA/Bay Area is fairly crap, cases deaths ok, but hospitalizations hard to come by
		- Most places don't have solid hospitalizations data
	-Indiana (Indianapolis) and St. Louis data might be accessible
		- Hospitalizations census and admissions, but they don't necessarily add up
-Rt issue: probably underfitting right now, but how do we fit more and what's the right amount of fitting?
	-**Come up with a gameplan for improvements to LEMMA**
		-How does Rt change?
		-Issue with St. Louis on hospital admissions and census data
			-model structure wrong or is there something with the data that's wrong?
				-e.g. hospitalization length of stay
		-Should people maybe move to using SC model?
			-What if we add our front end excel inputs to their backend model?
			-Freeze LEMMA and fork UCSC?
			-Basically how do we improve the backend of LEMMA while maintaining front end that people are comfortable with now?
			-Get it to work with SF and then see if we can add X feature to their model 
				-Maybe add PUIs to model fitting and see if we can make it work?
			-Two population model probably necessary in the near future: in STAN, or an improvement to LEMMA?
	* Two directions: Mission project and Berkeley Safe Campus study (could probably go one way or the other)
		-Mission study next steps: disparities angle, but also concentrated epidemic angle;
			-How much can we actually demonstrate this quantitatively?
				-e.g. essential workers and latinx community driving epidemic
				-How do we use modeling to extend this point?
					-How can we say something quantitative about extent of the picture in SF driven by concentrated epidemic?
						-Combine mission study with hospitalization data in some way
					-Supportive role for main paper
			-Separate paper on the role of essential workers, role of those unable to shelter in places
				-How does concentrated epidemic change the way we think about testing and SIP
				-How do we do targeted intervention e.g. pay people to stay home who wouldn't otherwise be able to?
		-Berkeley safe campus study -> touch base with Ivana, Jeremy, etc.
			-They have a target parameter and everything but are also doing simulations and stuff
***Priorities: 
	-buffing up LEMMA or adapting SC?
	-using ABM to say something quantitative about nature of mission study/outbreak
	-role of two-population model as well and comparison to LEMMA
